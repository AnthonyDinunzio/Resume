    <h3>Project #4: Calculator Program in C</h3>
    <p>Project Summary: Using the new skills I have learned in reading and writting C, create a working calculator program that takes an x and a y and provides the sum as an output.</p>
    <p>Purpose: Help understand how to program in C as well as how to correlate math with programming.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Project #5: Scores Program in C</h3>
    <p>Project Summary: Create a program that takes the users input for 4 different scores then returns the average of those scores as an output.</p>
    <p>Purpose: Sharpen my skills in writting C programs as well as learn the use of conditional statements. It aslo helped to understand how to get user input with a program and how to have the computer interact with that input.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Project #6: Scores 2.0 Program in C (use of arrays)</h3>
    <p>Project Summary: Create almost the exact same program as Scores but clean it up and make it more correct by the use of an array.</p>
    <p>Purpose: Understand what arrays are, how to use them, and how to keep code neat and decluttterd.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Project #7: Calculator 2.0 Program in C (ability to change operation)</h3>
    <p>Project Summary: Create almost the exact same calculator program but this time include the ability for the user to enter as my numbers as they would like and change the operation being done on those numbers.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h3>Project #10: Number Sorter Program in Python</h3>
    <p>Project Summary: Write a program that takes an input list and rearranges the elements in the list into a numerical order and print the new "Sorted list" as an output.</p>
    <p>Purpose: Help me understand algorithims without waiting on my courses to cover it in class.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Project #11: Quiz Program in Python</h3>
    <p>Project Summary: Create a program that gives the user a 10 question quiz with random questions and after the quiz is complete return to the user there score /10 as well as there score as a percentage for an output.</p>
    <p>Purpose: More practice for writting different kinds of programs and working with different types of data in a program.</p>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Project #12: Rock Paper Scissors using Object Oriented Programming in Python</h3>
